# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bohdan Kushnir

I am a seasoned Full-Stack Engineer, enriched with 6 years of significant experience spanning both frontend and backend domains.
My notable strength lies in my ability to design, test, and maintain both frontend and backend applications. Further, I possess an extensive understanding of various software languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and FronEnd frameworks such as React.js, Next.js, and React Native. Not to mention, my expertise in backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, Firebase, Headless CMS, etc, and databases like MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL makes me an all-round developer.
I am experienced in full project lifecycle management, from initial concept and design through to successful implementation and ongoing maintenance. 
My primary aim is to not just execute projects with high-quality results but also ensure timely completion. I closely adhere to functionality, user experience, performance, and coding standards while maintaining a keen eye for detail.
Whether you need a complete web application from scratch, an update to existing software, or some bugs fixed, I am confident that my expertise and diligence will deliver solutions that align perfectly with project objectives.
Looking forward to being of service and driving your project to success!
